**patchless** is a tiny Scala library which provides:

* A data type `Patch[T]`, which extends `T => T` and encapsulates a set of updates to be performed to values of type `T`.
* A typeclass `Patchable[T]`, which supports the data type above.

It uses [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) to derive `Patchable[T]` for any case class.

## Dependency

Patchless is published to Maven Central – put this in your build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.jeremyrsmith" %% "patchless" % "1.0.4"
```

## Usage
The core of patchless provides only two simple way to create a `Patch[T]` for any given `T`:

* The `apply` syntax (macro-driven):

```scala
import patchless.Patch
case class Foo(a: String, b: Int, c: Boolean)
val patch = Patch[Foo](b = 22)
```

* The `Patch.diff[T]` static method:

```scala
case class Foo(a: String, b: Int, c: Boolean)
val a = Foo("test", 22, true)
val b = Foo("patched", 22, true)
val patch = Patch.diff(a, b)
patch(a) // Foo("patched", 22, true)
patch(Foo("wibble", 44, false)) // Foo("patched", 44, false)
```

Additionally, the `patchless-circe` module provides decoders directly from JSON to `Patch[T]`. See
[below](#patchless-circe) for details.

### Using the patch fields
The primary advantage of `Patch[T]` over simply `T => T` is that the updated fields can be accessed as a shapeless
`Record` of `Option`s. Each field retains the name from the original case class `T`, but its value type is lifted to
an `Option` of the original type within the case class.

The `Record` is accessible in two ways. The first is simply by the `updates` member of the `Patch` value:

```scala
println(patch) // Some("patched") :: None :: None :: HNil
```

This alone doesn't turn out to be all that useful from a typelevel standpoint - Scala doesn't inherently know the type
of the `updates` field, so your options there are limited.

So patchless does some additional type voodoo to allow you to recover a statically known `Record` for a `Patch[T]` of a
concrete, statically known type `T`. This is done with the implicit enrichment method `patchUpdates`, which allows you
to do typelevel things like mapping over the updates `HList` or summoning typeclasses for it:

```scala
object mapUpdates extends Poly1 {
  implicit def cases[K <: Symbol, T](implicit
    name: Witness.Aux[K]
  ) = at[FieldType[K, T]] {
    field => name.value.name -> field.toString
  }
}
patch.patchUpdates.map(mapUpdates).toList
// List(("a", "Some(patched)"), ("b", "None"), ("c", "None")) 
```

Please note that this only works for a concrete `T`. If `T` is abstract (such as in a polymorphic method over `Patch`
types) then you'll still have to parameterize over various `HList` types and require various implicit shapeless `Aux`
typeclasses over them as usual – starting with `Patchable.Aux[T, U]` where `U` will be inferred to the type of the
`Updates` record for `T`.

```scala
def doPatchyStuff[T, U <: HList, A <: HList](patch: Patch[T])(implicit
  patchable: Patchable.Aux[T, U],
  liftAll: LiftAll.Aux[MyTC, U, A],
  toList: ToList[A, Any]
) = ???
```

Also, be aware that `patchUpdates` involves a typecast; it's assumed that the `Updates` of the `Patch[T]` value has the
same type as the `Patchable[T]` that is in implicit scope. This is usually a safe assumption, but it's not *guaranteed*
to be safe. In an effort to make it as close as possible to a guarantee, `Patchable` is defined as `sealed`, which means
that only the blessed derivations can ever be used to create it; these ought to be deterministic for a particular `T`,
but Scala provides no way to express this and thus a typecast is still necessary.

## patchless-circe

Derived decoders and encoders are provided in the `patchless-circe` module.

In build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.github.jeremyrsmith" %% "patchless-circe" % "1.0.2"
```

There are two different imports, depending on how you're using circe. You need to have at least `circe-generic`, and
you can also optionally use `circe-generic-extras` (which is marked as a provided dependency in case you don't use it).

You also need to be using automatic derivation for this to be of any use; it's not possible to derive a `Patch[T]` decoder
for a semiauto or manual decoder of `T`.

For vanilla automatic derivation:

```scala
import io.circe.generic.auto._
import patchless.circe._
import cats.syntax.either._ // for working with results

case class Foo(aString: String, bInt: Int)
val parsed = io.circe.parser.parse("""{"aString": "patched"}""")
parsed.valueOr(throw _).as[Patch[Foo]].valueOr(throw _)
parsed.updates          // Some("patched") :: None :: HNil
parsed(Foo("blah", 22)) // Foo("patched", 22)
```

Configurable derivation is the same, but import `patchless.circe.extras._` instead; your implicit `Configuration` will
be used to derive the decoders for `Patch` types.

Encoders work the same way, but be aware that the JSON output depends on the printer used – in particular, you'll
typically want to `dropNullKeys` if you're outputting `Patch` values to JSON.
